String Class Notes

String class - immutable
once contents of an object are created, they can never be modified
helps JVM reuse String objects
reduces memory overhead and increases performance
can be shared across multiple reference variables
 
final modifier to a String means it can't be reassigned a value
 
all methods in String class don't actually modify the contents, they create and return 
a new String object!

String concatenation is implemented by StringBuilder or StringBuffer classes behind the scenes
