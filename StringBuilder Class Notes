String Builder Notes
-mutable
-dealing with larger strings
-modifying contents of a string often, instead of creating a new object like String class
-improves performance of code

String Builder doesn't define method TRIM!


String Buffer is same as String Builder, EXCEPT : 
1. Methods of string buffer are synchronized, whereas methods of string builder aren't
-->only one thread of multiple threads can executed in StringBuffer unlike String Builder
2. String buffer is FOR MULTIPLE THREADS, unlike String Builder
